                  <p class="card-text fw-bold">Below is the tips for recommended transaction if you want to make, as follow:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Make sure ‘Both SEND or RECEIVE NBTC Address nor NBTC BOUNTY Address ’ is valid, absolutely - exactly from NBTC Wallet or NBTC BOUNTY Wallet Addres platform!

                    <dl>

                        <p>Is your HOT WALLET. Its function is TO KEEP NBTC asset with secure or you can use your 
                          ‘NBTC LIQUID BALANCE’ for activating new staking account within iStakeNBTC Platform 
                          maximum 40% from Staking Package.</p>
                    </dl>

                    <li>Every <strong>SEND TRANSACTION</strong> transmission made by the sender (the cryptograph) will be broadcasted to all nodes network on the blockchain and it will take a few minutes (normally 1-5 minutes) to be VERIFIED and VALIDATED by NeoBitcoin Blockchain Algorithm. At least wait for 5 to 10 minutes and sometime more (depend on line blockchain nodes traffic) to wait for the transaction settled (filled or succceed) then you can do the next transaction, or one transaction must be fully accomplished to do next one. </li>

                    <li>Make sure after making the <strong>SEND TRANSACTION,</strong> MUST wait for TXID or HASH auto-recorded that comes out from the block of NeoBitcoin Blockchain. It means that the TRANSACTION is running successfully, then iStakeNBTC Wallet System will be ready for the next SEND TRANSACTION. Otherwise you will experience an error on your wallet or the blockchain cannot process it. At least you may check the successful transaction in blockchain as your confirmation whether the transaction is successfully validated.</li>

                    <p class="fw-bold mt-3">WARNING:</p>
                    <p>NEVER DO others transactions when the 1st transaction UNVALIDATED yet. Wait for it till accomplished! When you keep doing it, the next transaction will cause an error or long delay.</p>
                    
                    <li><strong>WITHDRAWAL REWARD</strong> also means to move your gained rewards from the blockchain of iStakeNBTC PoS MINING POOL by sending an order as an algorithm to your IStakeNBTC wallet (NBTC LIQUID BALANCE) considered as internal platform or transactions (P2P). The same procedure with SEND TRANSACTION.</li>

                    <li>Make sure! MUST wait for the TRANSACTION successfully PROCESSED before doing the next and always DO REFRESH to the web browser for updating new data syncronized when the transaction already confirmed and recorded in blockchain. Sometime you need to re-login the staking account then do web REFRESH few times clicks to see the balance updated.</li>

                    <li>Each <strong>SUCCESFULL TRANSACTION</strong> made, will be confirmed & recorded on NeoBITCOIN Blockchain Explorer / web site and can be searched or proven for every TRANSACTION made transparantly by COPY the TXID no or HASH no or NBTC address to PASTE into the blockchain SEARCH column to see the transaction ledger.</li>

                    <p class="fw-bold mt-3">How ?</p>
                    <p>First, go to NeoBitcoin Blockchain explorer to make sure the transaction successfully VALIDATED then back to iSTakeNBTC account, relogin and refresh the web browser until the transaction fully-confirmed in staking account.</p>
                    <p><i class="bi bi-arrow-right-square-fill"></i> Go to NeoBitcoin blockchain explorer to check the successful transaction: <a href="https://explorer.neobitcoin.online" target="_blank">https://explorer.neobitcoin.online</a></p>

                    <li>Any miss-following the transaction procedure will cause system error, fail or might be very long delay.</li>
